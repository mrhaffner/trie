        <h2>A Basic Trie</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Selecting an efficient method to find autocomplete suggestions
            presents a unique challenge. This challenge is efficiently handled
            with a Trie a.k.a. Prefix Tree. A Trie is a specialized tree where
            each child node represents a character.
          </p>
          <p>
            A word in the Trie is indicated by following a path from the root to
            a node that is marked as being the end of a word. The location of a
            child node on its parent node's edges is used to determine what
            character the child node represents with a hash function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the large number of edges, representing a Trie visually can
            be space intensize. Consider a Trie with a character set containing
            only the letters "a", "b" and "c". "a" hashes to index 0, "b" to 1
            and "c" to 2. This Trie contains the suffixes: "a", "abc" and "ca".
            The root node represents the empty string which all Tries will
            contain by default. Witness this Trie:
          </p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img
              src="{{ url_for('static', filename='trie.jpg') }}"
              alt="A Trie"
            />
            <figcaption>A Trie with a small character set</figcaption>
          </div>
          <p>
            We want to use this Trie to get autocomplete suggestions for the
            prefix "a". We start by navigating to the "a" node. We will then
            perform a depth first search on all child nodes. As we search, we
            add the character value of the next node until we reach a node
            marked as the end of a valid suffix. We then add this word to the
            output. Since "a" itself is a valid suffix represented as the empty
            string, the output is: ["", "bc"]. Depending on our autocomplete
            implementation, we could merge this result with the given prefix to
            give: ["a", "abc"].
          </p>
          <p>
            If we were to perform a search on the Trie with the prefix "", we
            would get as a result all valid suffixes in the Trie. In this case,
            we choose to ignore the root of the Trie as a result. We get: ["a",
            "abc", "ca"]. Note that our results appear in alphabetical order -
            ie in the order they are hashed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can see a simple implementation with the following search bar:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="search-container">
          <form id="trie-form">
            <div id="trie-search-bar" class="search-bar">
              <input
                id="search-input"
                class="search"
                maxlength="200"
                type="text"
                name="search"
                autocapitalize="off"
                autocomplete="off"
                autocorrect="off"
                spellcheck="false"
                title="Search"
                value=""
              />
            </div>
            <div id="suggestions" class="auto-complete" hidden>
              <div class="auto-line"></div>
            </div>
          </form>
          <figcaption>
            Try me! (<b>Warning:</b> Some suggestions are NSFW)
          </figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          This implementation is efficient. Suggestions are found in O(H+N)
          time. "H" represents the height of the Trie - ie the longest prefix we
          can find suggestions for. "N" represents the number of nodes in your
          subtree which has a maximum size equal to the number of nodes in your
          Trie. "H" can never be higher than "N", so the complexity is O(N).
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximum size of a Trie is (C<sup>(H+1)</sup>-1)/(C-1). "C" is the
          size of our character set: 26 English letters + 1 space character =
          27. It is not neccesary to support strings of a potentially unlimited
          length. Most searches are short, so we can set a reasonable max height
          for our Trie. In our implementation, we chose 200.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximum size of our Trie is 1.9&times;10<sup>286</sup> nodes. That
          is a very large constant. Without a fixed height or character set, the
          size of a Trie is O(C<sup>H</sup>). Memory usage is the main drawback
          of the Trie - due to the typically large number of null pointers found
          in each node's edges array.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our implementation, "N" is also a constant so finding a list of
          valid suffixes for a prefix actually happens in O(1) time. Deletions
          and insertions are done in O(H) time. Again, this become O(1). We
          choose to delete nodes by marking them as not being the end of a
          suffix. This will increase speed at the cost of extra memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Trie will find all suggestions for our given prefix. One feature
          of the Trie is that all suggestions will be ouput in alphabetical
          order. Alphabetical order is not likely the most relevant. But how do
          we choose which suggestions to show?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>A Weighted Trie</h2>
        <p>
          We can make some simple modifications to our Trie to add a weight to
          each suffix. People will generally be looking for the most commonly
          searched terms. Therefore, the weight of a node will represent how
          often that term has appeared in searches.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new weight property will also serve to determine if a node is the
          end of a suffix. Nodes with a weight 1 or greater represent the end of
          a suffix.
        </p>
        <p>Try the new search bar and compare the results from the original:</p>
        <div class="search-container">
          <form id="trie-weighted-form">
            <div id="trie-weighted-search-bar" class="search-bar">
              <input
                id="weighted-search-input"
                class="search"
                maxlength="200"
                type="text"
                name="search"
                autocapitalize="off"
                autocomplete="off"
                autocorrect="off"
                spellcheck="false"
                title="Search"
                value=""
              />
            </div>
            <div id="weighted-suggestions" class="auto-complete" hidden>
              <div class="auto-line"></div>
            </div>
          </form>
          <figcaption>
            Try me! (<b>Warning:</b> Some suggestions are NSFW)
          </figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          We see that suggestions are now sorted in descending order based on
          weight. Sorting our suggestions does slow down retrieval.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use Timsort - the default sorting algorithm in Python. Timsort is a
          good choice because the algorithm is stable. This means that it will
          automatically keep the previously existing alphabetical ordering after
          sorting by weight for items of equal weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Timsort operates in O(S&times;log(S)) time. "S" represents the number
          of suffixes that match our prefix. The number of suffixes found is
          limited by the maximum number of nodes that our Trie may contain. The
          maximum number of suffixes in a Trie is actually "N" - imagine a Trie
          where every node is marked as the the end of a valid suffix.
        </p>
        <p>
          The small performance hit is well worth the benefit of drastically
          enhanced user experience. Now that our Trie is showing more relevant
          suggestions, what can we do to improve performance?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>A Cached Trie</h2>
        <p>
          Traversing the entire subtree from the end of a given prefix everytime
          we want suggestions is undesirable. We can significantly improve
          performance by generating a cache of suggestions for every node in the
          Trie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suggestions are now found in O(H) time - ie the maximum length of a
          suffix. Try our new search bar:
        </p>
        <div class="search-container">
          <form id="trie-cached-form">
            <div id="trie-cached-search-bar" class="search-bar">
              <input
                id="cached-search-input"
                class="search"
                maxlength="200"
                type="text"
                name="search"
                autocapitalize="off"
                autocomplete="off"
                autocorrect="off"
                spellcheck="false"
                title="Search"
                value=""
              />
            </div>
            <div id="cached-suggestions" class="auto-complete" hidden>
              <div class="auto-line"></div>
            </div>
          </form>
          <figcaption>
            Try me! (<b>Warning:</b> Some suggestions are NSFW)
          </figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          Creating a cache for every node will amplify memory use. Fortunately,
          it is not neccesary to store a cache of potentially unlimited sized.
          This increases our memory usage by a small constant: "L".
        </p>
        <p>
          Caching also creates a performance trade off. Insertions and deletions
          from the Trie will now need to update the cache for every affected
          node.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every character in the suffix, we will need to gather all valid
          suffixes, sort and truncate them. What took place in O(H) time now
          takes O(H&times;N&times;L&times;log(L)) time. Building our Trie this
          way takes 173 seconds - that is 1,700 times slower than the Weighted
          Trie!
        </p>
        <p>
          We can do better for insertion. For every affected node, we check for
          a duplicate suffix and delete that if it exists. We then add the new
          entry to the cache and sort it by weight. The cache entries will no
          longer be sorted by suffix as a secondary sorting criteria. This is
          fine for our implementation. We then truncate the cache if it exceeds
          the size limit. That leaves us with O(H&times;L&times;log(L) - much
          faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we are stuck with the slow performance for delete.
          Deletions affecting nodes with a full cache will require a complete
          rebuild.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, deletions will generally be rare if they happen at all.
          Updates may be performed with a complete rebuild. In our
          implementation, we only use insertions to build the Trie and deletions
          never at all.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>
          We discussed how we could improve performance with caching. Let's look
          at some some measurements. We populate our Tries with 5,334 scraped
          top search results. Several trials give the following averages:
        </p>
        <table>
          <caption>
            Trie Performance in Microseconds
          </caption>
          <tr>
            <th>Trie Type</th>
            <th>Get Suffixes</th>
            <th>Delete</th>
            <th>Single Insert</th>
            <th>Insert All</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Standard</td>
            <td>800</td>
            <td>23</td>
            <td>7.4</td>
            <td>80,000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Weighted</td>
            <td>850</td>
            <td>23</td>
            <td>7.7</td>
            <td>100,000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Cached</td>
            <td>5.2</td>
            <td>54,000</td>
            <td>29</td>
            <td>340,000</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          We ended up reducing our retrieval time by over 99% with caching.
          That's 163 times faster! That improvement came at the cost of memory
          and insertion/deletion performance.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>A Study of Google Autocomplete</h2>
        <p>
          We can use Google as a gold standard for a websearch autocomplete. Let
          us look at the results of a few different searches from different
          starting conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a clear search history and not logged into a Google account we
          click on the searchbar:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container search-img-container">
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='blank-no-history.jpg') }}"
            alt="Google trending search results"
          />
          <figcaption>Trending searches</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          With no history to draw from, Google decideds to show us the current
          trending search results. This brings up a question on search weight.
          How does Google actually calculate the weight of a suggestion? We used
          hits in our implementaion, but Google likely includes trending data
          when calculating weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we click on the searchbar with a history of typing "app" into the
          searchbar:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container search-img-container">
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='blank-with-history.jpg') }}"
            alt="Google search results with history"
          />
          <figcaption>Searches based on history without input</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          Our suggestions are now based on our previous search. Notice the
          results are not based purely on the prefix "app", but appear to based
          on what people clicked on after searching for "app".
        </p>
        <p>
          We now look at what happens when we type "app" into search without
          being logged in:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container search-img-container">
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='app-original.jpg') }}"
            alt="Google search results for 'app'"
          />
          <figcaption>Search results for "app"</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          These search results look a lot more familiar to our implementation.
          The one difference is the results are based on location. Does Google
          keep a different search set for every city? Probably not. Google most
          certainly has different data sets for different regions, but likely
          not at the city level. Notice that the city results appear right after
          "near me". The city data is probably being added after getting the
          first set of search suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happens when we type in a prefix with no matching suffixes? Let's
          try "appp":
        </p>
        <div class="image-container search-img-container">
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='appp.jpg') }}"
            alt="Google search results for 'appp'"
          />
          <figcaption>Search results for "appp"</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          The results are the same as for "app". This shows a new feature of the
          Trie: spellchecking. In this case, we navigate down to the node
          representing the last "p" in "appp". This node has no valid suffixes.
          So, we use the suffixes of the closest ancestor node with valid
          suffixes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spellchecking is best accomplished with a cached trie. If we were to
          use a non-cached trie, we would need to generate a list of valid
          suffixes at every character node in the prefix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now look at the result of searching for "app" while logged into
          a Google account with previous search history.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container search-img-container">
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='app-logged-in.jpg') }}"
            alt="Google search results for 'app' while logged in"
          />
          <figcaption>Search results for "app" while logged in</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          You will notice a few changes here. Google now appends a list of our
          previous searches that match the prefix. This could be handled with a
          seperate trie for our search history. This trie could be weighted
          based on how long ago the searches were made. We would want to include
          recent searches, but probably not searches from 5 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other results are also different. This is likely due to a
          differing search history. Again, suggesting that our history is part
          of the weight calculation. This could potentially be done with a per
          user Trie.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Trie acts as an efficient interface to get search results. A trie
          is not the best option for general purpose storage. In a live search
          engine, a seperate database should be used to store history of all
          searches, the number of times they were searched, and other data.
          Based on this data, you could filter out innapropriate suggestions,
          calculate weights, and then build a Trie for consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep this project simple and take advantage of free hosting, a real
          database was not used. All data is stored in memory by the running
          Flask application. A better solution would be to use an in memory
          database like Redis to store the Tries.
        </p>
        <p>
          We covered only a few variations of the Trie. There are many more with
          their own unique properties. For instance, a Compressed Trie can be
          used to cut down on the large memory usage of a standard Trie.

          I got the idea for this project from
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/"
            >System Design Interview by Alex Xu</a
          >. My goal for reading the book was to get a good overview of how
          highly scalable applications run. I got that and tons of great project
          ideas.
