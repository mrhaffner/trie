        <h1>Implementing Autocomplete with Trie</h1>

        <h2>A Basic Trie</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Selecting an efficient method to find search suggestions presents a
            unique challenge. This challenge is efficiently handled with a Trie
            a.k.a. Prefix Tree. We can see a simple implementation with the
            following search bar:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="search-container">
          <form id="trie-form">
            <div id="trie-search-bar" class="search-bar">
              <input
                id="search-input"
                class="search"
                maxlength="2048"
                type="text"
                name="search"
                autocapitalize="off"
                autocomplete="off"
                autocorrect="off"
                autofocus
                spellcheck="false"
                title="Search"
                value=""
              />
            </div>
            <div id="suggestions" class="auto-complete" hidden>
              <div class="auto-line"></div>
            </div>
          </form>
          <figcaption>
            Try me! (<b>Warning:</b> Some suggestions are NSFW)
          </figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
          This implementation is efficient. Suggestions are found in O(P+H*C*N)
          time. "P" represents the length of the prefix that we are trying to
          get suggestions for. "H" represents the height of the subtree of the
          Trie we are trying to get suggestions from. This is the length of the
          longest suffix in the subtree. "C" represents the character set the
          Trie supports. In our implementation, the character set is 26 English
          letters + 1 (space).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not neccesary to support strings of a potentially unlimited
          length. Most searches are short, so we can set a reasonable max height
          for our Trie. In our implementation, we chose 200 for the max length
          of a word in the Trie. Since "P", "H" and "C" are constants,
          retrieving autocomplete suggestions is done in O(N) time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deletions and insertions are done in O(H) time which reduces to O(1).
          The main drawback of the Trie is the large amount of memory that is
          used given. Every node has a number of children equal to the size of
          the character set. Generally, most of the children of a given node
          will be null pointers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Trie will find all suggestions for our given prefix. One feature
          of the Trie is that all suggestions will be ouput in alphabetical
          order. We will need to limit the suggestions we show. But how do we
          choose which suggestions to show? Alphabetical order is not likely the
          most relevant. Stay tuned to find out more!
