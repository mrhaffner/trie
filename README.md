## The Trie Project

Exploring and optimizing search suggestions with Trie (Prefix Tree)

Version 3.1.0 is live:

http://mrhaffner.pythonanywhere.com/

## Purpose

- Practice Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Gain experience optimizing search performance
- Learn the ins and outs of the Trie

## Instructions

Clone the repo then setup your Python environment:

```sh
$ python3.9 -m venv env
$ python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need a search_terms.json file to populate your Tries in non-debug mode. I scraped a large list of top search suggestions. The format for the JSON file is:

```sh
[
    {"term": "facebook", "hits": 1},
    {"term": "youtube", "hits": 5}
]
```

Run the Flask app for testing (default FLASK_DEBUG=false for production):

```sh
$ export FLASK_APP=app
$ export FLASK_DEBUG=true
$ flask run
```

In order to run the functional tests you will need Google Chrome installed and a Chrome webdriver matching your Chrome browser version (If you update your browser, you will will need to update your chromedriver!). You can download the webdriver here:
[Chrome Webdrivers](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

You will need to follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system. If you are using MacOS:

```sh
$ mv path/to/your/unzipped/chromedriver /usr/local/bin
$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
```

For the functional tests to work, the Flask app will need to be running in debug mode. You will also need to change the "apiUri" in script.js by commenting the live uri and uncommenting the test uri.

Run the Python tests:

```sh
$ coverage run -m unittest
```

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ coverage report -m
$ coverage html
```

## Acknowledgements

I got the idea for this project from System Design Interview by Alex Xu. I read the book to get a good overview of how highly scalable systems operate and was not disappointed.
